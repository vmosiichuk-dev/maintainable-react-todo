# Maintainable React Todo

This practice project, built with React, focuses on applying key principles of maintainability, reusability, and accessibility to an application. Throughout this project, I will aim to use advanced refactor techniques for better scalability and clarity while implementing features that enhance user experience.

## Features:
- [ ] **Add Todo to the List**  
  Implement a feature that allows users to add tasks to a list.


- [ ] **Complete Todo**  
  Enable users to mark tasks as completed when clicked.


- [ ] **Custom Hooks for State Management**  
  Use custom hooks to manage state efficiently and reduce component complexity.


- [ ] **Summary Information**  
  Display a summary of tasks (e.g., number of completed and remaining tasks) to improve task tracking and user visibility.


- [ ] **Search Functionality**  
  Implement a search bar that filters tasks by keyword, making it easier to find specific todos.


- [ ] **Accessibility Enhancements**  
  Follow best practices to ensure the app is accessible to all users, including keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
